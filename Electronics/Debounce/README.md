# Debounce Sketch for Arduino

This project demonstrates how to implement button debounce logic in Arduino using a simple sketch. The circuit and code are designed for simulation on the [Wokwi Arduino Simulator](https://wokwi.com/).

## Files

- `sketch.ino`: The main Arduino sketch that handles button input with debounce logic.
- `diagram.json`: Circuit diagram for Wokwi simulation.
- `README.md`: Readme file

## What is Debouncing?

Mechanical switches often produce multiple signals (bounces) when pressed or released. Debouncing ensures only a single signal is registered per button press.

## How to Use

1. Open the project in the [Wokwi Simulator](https://wokwi.com/projects/427282273725213697).
2. Upload `sketch.ino`.
3. Run the simulation and press the button to see debouncing in action.
