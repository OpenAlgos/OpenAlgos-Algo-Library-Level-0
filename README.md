# OpenAlgos Algorithm Library

Welcome to **OpenAlgos**, an open-source algorithm library designed to help students and developers learn and implement simple algorithms in Python. This library provides easy-to-understand solutions to basic problems, making coding more accessible.

## Algorithms Available

1. **Banking Algorithm**
   - Perform basic banking operations like credit and debit with a starting balance of 1000 points.
   - Error handling for insufficient balance and invalid operations.

2. **Stone Paper Scissors**
   - A simple implementation of the classic game against the computer.
   - Includes logic to determine the winner based on user and computer choices.

3. **Unique Guess The Number Game**
   - A fun number-guessing game where you gain points based on how close your guess is to the computer's number.
   - Set your own points target and input limit to customize the gameplay.

## Installation
